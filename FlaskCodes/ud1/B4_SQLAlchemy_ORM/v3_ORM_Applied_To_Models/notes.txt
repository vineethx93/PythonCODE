ORM will return None is there are no matching values
eg.
user = UserModel.query.filter_by(username=username).first()
this will return an object of UserModel Class if exists
if not found then will return None

In Model classes.. use as classmethod(cls) for methods that are not processing an incoming object of that class
If that method is processing/accessing/act-on an incoming object of that class then use object methods(self)
eg:
find_by_name(username) <- classmethod
upsert(object) <- object method (since its working on the object itself ie.. obj.upsert())
