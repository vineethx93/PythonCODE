resources package should contain only the modules with Resource classes ie.. # class Xyz(Resource)
any non-resource class should be removed from these modules before moving to the resources package(good practice)

A resource is:
 - what an API think of,
 - things that clients can ask for,
 - things an API response with
 - eg.. users, items, stores, students..
 - an EXTERNAL representation of an entity

A model is:
 - is something like a helper class to store some data
 - also may contain some methods to work on those data
 - our INTERNAL representation of an ENTITY
 - what gives us more flexibility in the program without polluting the "Resources"

methods that are not called by any API must be moved outside of resource class
and should be included in a proper model class
